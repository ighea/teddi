This excuse for a game is rushed entry for a local game competition while trying to write a 2D game engine with C++ and SDL. Never actually meant to be played.

## System requirements:
* hardware: OpenGL-supported 3D-card
* libs:	libSDL, libSDL-ttf, libSDL-mixer (included for Windows binary.)

## Story:
Teddi's beloved red ribbon is stolen and you'll have to help Teddi to get it back!

## Controls:
Use arrow keys to move and turn Teddi and left ctrl to throw apples.

## Version history:

### 0.2:
* Quick fixes and improvements
* 3 Randomly generated levels with unique villains!

### 0.1: 
* first and perhaps last release
* game is playable, mut replaying with same startup is buggy

## About files:
* font.tff is Vera.ttf from ttf-bitstream-vera font-package
* all effect sound files are self-made (didn't believe so? huh)
* all images are self-made
* music.wav song Electronic Beat by Alexander Blu from http://www.orangefreesounds.com/. The song is permitted for non-commercial use under license Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)
